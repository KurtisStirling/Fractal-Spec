# Plan-files / Design

- Plan.md is the unified place for future intent at each subject; it is the backlog/roadmap/task list locally.  
- No parallel or central backlog; plans nest through the subject tree.  
- Format is free (lists, tables, timelines) as long as the function is clear.  
- Temporary scaffolding: plans are promoted or cleaned once Design/Requirements are updated.  
- Demonstrated through this model’s child subjects and the RPI example under `work/`.
