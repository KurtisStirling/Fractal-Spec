# RPI / Design

- RPI lives under work as a subject to illustrate the agentic overlay within this model.  
- Child subjects: `work/RPI/Plans/` and `work/RPI/Research/` hold temporary intent and discovery for this illustration.  
- Promotion path: Research informs Plan; Plan drives Implement; updates flow to permanent truth (Requirements/Design) of the target subject; temporary artefacts are then archived/cleaned.
- Research discipline: document what exists without critique; prefer direct evidence (aligns with `stolen-commands-RPI/research_codebase.md`).  
- Purpose: show how temporary truths are structured and then promoted/removed.
