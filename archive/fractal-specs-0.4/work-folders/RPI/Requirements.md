# RPI / Requirements

R01 — Model the Research → Plan → Implement loop as a subject within work.  
R02 — Show how temporary artefacts (research/plan) are promoted into permanent truth.  
R03 — Keep the scope illustrative; avoid duplicating root guidance.  
R04 — Align with function-over-form: demonstrate roles, not prescribe formats.
