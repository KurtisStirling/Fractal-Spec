# Research-file / Design

- Role: hold temporary discovery and analysis that inform the subject’s Plan and eventual Design/Requirements updates.
- Discipline: document what exists without critique; prefer direct evidence (aligns with `stolen-commands-RPI/research_codebase.md` when researching code).
- Promotion: key findings move into Plan; outcomes then update permanent truth (Design/Requirements). Clean or archive research afterward.
- Format: freeform (notes, lists, diagrams) as long as it stays concise and scoped to the subject.
