# Fractal Specs / Requirements

## Demand

R01 — Provide a predictable, repeating structure at every level.  
R02 — Impose no semantics on hierarchy.  
R03 — Remain lightweight and minimal.  
R04 — Cleanly separate demand (Requirements), supply (Design), and future intent (Plan).  
R05 — Preserve enduring intent and rationale.  
R06 — Prevent Chesterton’s Fence failures.  
R07 — Enable scoped reasoning for humans and AI.  
R08 — Support infinite recursion.  
R09 — Avoid prescribing workflow or ceremony.  
R10 — Unify all forward-looking work into planning.  
R11 — “Plan is where the work is done”; no centralised backlog.  
R12 — Keep function over form: mandate roles, not syntax or file naming, as long as the function stays clear within each subject.  
R13 — Provide navigation consistency: same kinds of content live in the same place at every level.  
R14 — Allow subject-scoped duplication of core files (e.g., many `Requirements.md`), disambiguated by path.  
R15 — Support optional collateral that explains current design without becoming a dumping ground.
R16 — Child subjects (components/parts) are sibling folders named for the subject; no dedicated `Components/` wrapper.
R17 — Provide naming defaults (Title Case core files; lowercase `work/`; Title Case `Supporting-Files/`; consistent convention for everything else) while allowing subject-level choice.  
R18 — Offer optional defaults/add-ons (e.g., changelog, frontmatter, What/Why/Status/Priority) without mandating format.
