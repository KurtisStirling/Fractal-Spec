# Semantics / Design

- Meaning-free hierarchy: folders carry no enforced meaning; teams choose whether a subject represents a business area, subsystem, feature, or UI element.  
- User-defined semantics: examples can vary per audience (business, PMs, engineers) without changing structure.  
- Relabelling: subjects can be regrouped or renamed without structural change; only the roles of files stay fixed.
