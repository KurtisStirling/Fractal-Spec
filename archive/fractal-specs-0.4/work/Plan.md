# Fractal Specs Roadmap

## Now
- Establish LLM bootloader file (includes token-efficiency rationale and session open/close guidance).
- Add Kurtis hand drawn diagrams that explain the framework concepts.
- Get claude to review 0.4 structure and content vs whats in 0.3

## Next
- Add optional examples section for expressing Requirements/Design/Plan content (MoSCoW, AC checklists, G/W/T flows) without making them mandatory.
- Adapt session-close pattern for Microcosm (LLM shutdown/hand-off cues).

## Later (after structure stable)
- Create commands analogous to stolen-commands-RPI, adapted to Microcosm structure:
  - create_plan (Microcosm-aligned)
  - implement_plan (Microcosm-aligned)
  - iterate_plan (Microcosm-aligned)
  - research_codebase (Microcosm-aligned)
