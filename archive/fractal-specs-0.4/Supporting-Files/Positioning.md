# Positioning / Related Work

Fractal Specs sits in the space of documentation and architecture modelling but differs from established models:

- **C4 Model** — Focuses on layered architectural diagrams (Context → Container → Component → Code). Not recursive at the file level; no supply/demand framing.  
- **arc42** — Large, structured architecture template. Heavyweight, fixed sections, non-fractal, not semantic-agnostic.  
- **4+1 View Model** — Multiple architectural views (Logical, Development, Process, Physical + Scenarios). Not a recursive documentation skeleton; does not define file roles or hierarchy anatomy.  
- **Agile Documentation / “Just Enough Documentation”** — Guides how much to document, not how to structure it. No supply/demand, fractal recursion, or unified planning.  
- **Component Libraries (e.g., fractal.build)** — Tooling for UI components; unrelated to systemic documentation skeletons.

Fractal Specs combines:
- A recursive skeleton.  
- Semantic freedom.  
- Supply/demand framing (Requirements/Design).  
- A unified planning mechanism (Plan at the subject is where the work is done).  
- A strict “enforce function, not form” philosophy.
