# Requirements-Files / Requirements

R01 — Capture ongoing demand for the subject (what must remain true and why).  
R02 — Keep it distilled; avoid collateral or papertrail content.  
R03 — Allow any expression style; function is fixed, form is free.  
R04 — Support optional additions (e.g., changelog, statuses) without mandating them.
