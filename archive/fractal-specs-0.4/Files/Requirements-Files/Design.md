# Requirements-Files / Design

- Role: future truth/demand for the subject.  
- Content: problems → desired outcomes, constraints, use cases, JTBD, personas, non-functional needs.  
- Flexibility: any structure is acceptable; optional helpers include What/Why/Status/Priority and compact changelog (HTML `<details>`).  
- Separation: no collateral here; keep references in Design or Supporting-Files.  
- Scope: subject-scoped; multiple `Requirements.md` across the tree are expected and disambiguated by path.***
