# Design-Files / Design

- Role: present-tense supply for the subject (architecture, flows, data models, UI structure, APIs, decisions).  
- Flexibility: format is free; optional helpers include YAML frontmatter (created/last-updated/version/used-by) and HTML-wrapped changelog.  
- Linkage: reference Supporting-Files for collateral (diagrams, ERDs, specs, validation aids).  
- Scope: subject-scoped; multiple `Design.md` files are expected; paths disambiguate.
