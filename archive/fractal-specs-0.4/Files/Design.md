# Files / Design

- Core roles: `Requirements.md` = demand/future truth; `Design.md` = supply/current truth; `Plan.md` = unified forward-looking work at the subject; `Research.md` = temporary discovery; `Supporting-Files/` = durable, referenced collateral (no drafts/noise).  
- Function over form: any structure or naming is acceptable if the function is clear and consistent within the subject; Title Case core files, lowercase `work/`, Title Case `Supporting-Files/`, consistent convention (kebab-case default) for everything else.  
- Optional defaults: Requirements may use What/Why/Status/Priority and a compact HTML changelog; Design may use frontmatter (created/last-updated/version/used-by) and HTML changelog; Plans stay single-source of truth for work; Research is temporary and promoted/cleaned after use.  
- Scope: subject-scoped; multiple `Requirements.md` and `Design.md` are expected across the tree, disambiguated by path.
