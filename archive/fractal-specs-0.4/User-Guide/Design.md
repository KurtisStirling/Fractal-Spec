# User Guide / Design

## Audience Guides

- Business & Leadership: Requirements show enduring needs; Design shows how it works today; Plan shows what will happen next and why. Inputs map to Requirements (strategic goals), Design (processes/constraints), Plan (roadmaps/commitments).
- Product Managers: Requirements = what “good” looks like; Design = what exists; Plan = roadmap → backlog → tasks (the plan at the subject is where the work is done). Roadmaps/prioritisation → Plan; acceptance criteria → Requirements; discovery notes → work/Research.md.
- Developers & Engineers: Requirements capture demand (behaviours, constraints, edge cases); Design captures supply (architecture, data models, flows, decisions); Plan expresses implementation work. Artefacts map: diagrams/schemas → Design; edge cases → Requirements; refactors/tasks → Plan.

## FAQ

- What makes it “fractal”? Same tiny anatomy recurs at every level; each subject is a microcosm of its parent and a macrocosm of its children.
- Why is this a skeleton and not a methodology? Only the folder structure and file roles are fixed; expression is up to you.
- How do Requirements vs Design work? Requirements = demand; Design = supply; Plan = how supply will evolve.
- Does it impose semantics or workflow? No. You decide what the subject represents and how planning is done.
- How does planning work? No central backlog; each subject’s Plan.md is where the work is done; plans nest and roll up naturally.
- How large or small should a subject be? Any size—from organisation to UI control.
- Is this heavy? No; function is enforced, form is unconstrained.
