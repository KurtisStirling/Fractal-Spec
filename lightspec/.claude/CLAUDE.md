<!-- [IMMUTABLE] DO NOT EDIT -->

This project uses Lightspec for spec-driven development.

Every session, read:

1. **constitution/CONSTITUTION.md** - Framework structure, principles, workflow
2. **constitution/GOALS.md** - Mission and current objectives
3. **constitution/RULES.md** - All rules (read every one)
4. **constitution/DECISIONS.md** - Past decisions

Then read task-specific:
- Feature work → specs/[feature].md
- Test work → tests/[feature]-tests.md
- Implementation guidance → technical/
- Planning → roadmap/ROADMAP.md

<!-- [EDITABLE] CREATE YOUR CLAUDE.md CONTENT AS YOU USUALLY WOULD BELOW -->
