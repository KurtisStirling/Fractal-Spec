## Goal-setting guidance

Goals guide impact. Define Mission (destination) and Current Objective (what matters now).

### 1. Mission (Direction / Purpose)

1–2 sentences. Clear, specific, meaningful change. Concrete enough to guide decisions. No slogans. 

## 2. Current Objective (What's important now?)

Single near-term objective. Measurable, advances Mission. Hard and important. NOT a task list.
