# Global Rules

Read all rules. Non-negotiable and global.

## Universal Rules (Framework)

R1: **The immutable sections of the Lightspec framework cannot be modified.**

R2: **All work must follow: Domain Spec → Test Spec → Tasks → Implementation.**

R3: **Use designated locations per File Structure in CONSTITUTION.md. Don't create ad hoc documentation outside the framework structure.**

---

<!-- [EDITABLE] CUSTOMIZE BELOW -->

## Context-Specific Rules (Project Requirements)

Add project rules starting at R4.

**Examples:** R4 (password minimum 12 chars), R5 (REST/JSON APIs), R6 (all decisions logged in DECISIONS.md).

### v1 - 2025-12-04

**Universal Rules Established:** R1-R3

Framework-provided rules governing Lightspec workflow and structure.

**R1: Framework Immutability** - Maintains framework integrity across projects

**R2: Spec → Test → Task → Code Workflow** - Enforces spec/test-driven development; prevents "vibe coding"

**R3: Use Designated Locations** - Eliminates ad hoc documentation; maintains framework structure

**Context-Specific Rules:** None yet (add yours at R4+)

### Template for Future Entries

```markdown
### v2 - YYYY-MM-DD

**Changes:** Added R4 (REST APIs); Modified R5 (i18n clarified); Removed R6 (deprecated)

**Rationale:** R4 ensures consistent API design; R5 reduces ambiguity; R6 replaced by R7.

**Notes:** R4 from Architecture team; R5 minimal impact; R6 users migrate to R7.
